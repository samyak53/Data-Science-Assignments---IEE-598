# Assignment 2

This directory contains all scripts which were submitted as a part of Assignment 2.

### What is in here:  

This assignment is available in `Ridge_Lasso_Regression.ipynb`which is a python notebook containing the analysis for Lasso and Ridge Regression Techniques. `test.csv` and `train.csv` are the csv files which contain the data which was used to do the analysis. `Gradient_Descent.ipynb` contains a script to perform optimization of Gradient Descent. Ridge Regression was used here. `BIC.ipynb` contains script for tuning parameter selection for Ridge Regression using Bayesian Information criteria (BIC).


### Important Tasks: 

* Sampled 100 points from 0 to 10 as our training samples to use the polynomial regression to fit this sin function and used a 10th order polynomial
* Selected tuning parameter to solve Ridge Regression
* Computed and plotted RSS and Degree of Freedom Change as per the tuning parameter λ.
* Computed and plotted the BIC Criterion function for each tuning parameter λ.
* Used K-Fold to perform cross validation and reported mean sum of square error and selected the best λ.
*  Explored the use of Lasso and Ridge regression for the housing price prediction.
*  Preprocessed the data using normalisation and One-Hot Encoding.
*  Applied Lasso with different Tuning Parameters and plotted cross-validation errors.
*  Applied Ridge Regression with different Tuning Parameters and plotted cross-validation errors.
