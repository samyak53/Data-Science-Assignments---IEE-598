# Assignment 3

This directory contains all scripts which were submitted as a part of Assignment 3.

### What is in here:  

This assignment is available in `Click_through_rate.ipynb`which is a python notebook containing the script for implementation of Support Vector Machine, Regularized SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosted Trees. `data.csv` is the csv file which contain the data which was used to do the analysis. `Kernel_Ridge_regression.ipynb` contains a script to perform Kernel Ridge Regression on 2D linear functions. 


### Important Tasks: 

* Performed linear regression and reported the training and testing accuracy.
* Used Kernel Ridge Regression and reported training and testing accuracy. Also, used cross validation to select best tuning parameters.
* Used the Random Forest Regressor and reported training and testing accuracy.
* Used LinearSVC and added balanced weights to handle the class-imbalance issue.
* Computed precision/recall, F1 score and confusion matrix.
* Added penalty and explored the use of 'l1' and 'l2' penalties and selected the best tuning parameter C.
* Implemented Logistic Regression and plotted the ROC curve. 
* Implemented Random Forest, used cross validation to select the best tuning parameters and plotted the ROC curve.
* Implemented xgboost library, plotted the ROC curve, precision recall curve and computed F1 score and confusion matrix.
