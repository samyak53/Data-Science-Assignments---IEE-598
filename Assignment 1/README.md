# Assignment 1

This directory contains all scripts which were submitted as a part of Assignment 1.

### What is in here:  

This assignment is available in `Multiple_Linear_regression.ipynb`which is a python notebook containing the analysis. `houseprice.csv` is a csv file which contains the data which was used to do the analysis. `Polynomial_Regression_model.ipynb` contains a simulation to estimate bias and variance for the polynomial model.

### Important Tasks: 

* Plotted the correlation between all the input variables and output variables pairs.
* Identified the first three pairs with strongest correlation (either positive or negative).
* Conducted the simple linear regression of the response ’medv’ with each of the 13 variables with splitting the data into training and testing and evaluated the testing accuracy for each model (13 in total).
* Generated the plot for each model and reported the Residual Sum of Square for each model.
* Performed multiple linear regression to predict the response ’medv’ with all the 13 input variables and evaluate the testing accuracy.
* Compared the accuracy with the simple linear regression with 13 variables.
* Used simulation to estimate the bias and variance for polynomial model from order 1 to 20
